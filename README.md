## üèÅ **Project Title:**  
**Formula 1 Race Analysis and Outcome Prediction**

---

### üìò **1. Project Overview**
This project involves the development of a data science application that explores historical Formula 1 (F1) race data and uses machine learning models to predict the outcome of races. The application will analyze driver and constructor performance, circuit statistics, and other race-related features to predict whether a driver will finish a race and possibly finish in the top positions.

---

### üéØ **2. Objectives**
- Perform data cleaning and integration of multiple F1 datasets.
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on key race performance metrics.
- Build a machine learning model to:
  - Predict whether a driver will finish a race.
  - Predict a driver's final race position or if they‚Äôll be on the podium.
- Visualize important insights using data visualization libraries.
- Deploy an interactive interface using Streamlit.

### üßæ **4. Dataset**
**Source:** [Formula 1 World Championship Dataset (1950‚Äì2020) ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)

**Key Files:**
- `drivers.csv`, `constructors.csv`, `races.csv`
- `results.csv`, `qualifying.csv`, `lap_times.csv`, `pit_stops.csv`

---

### üìä **5. Project Workflow**
#### **5.1 Data Collection and Preparation**
- Load and inspect datasets
- Handle missing data, duplicates
- Merge datasets for a unified format
- Create new features (e.g., pit stop count, average lap time, grid position, etc.)

#### **5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyze top-performing drivers and teams
- Investigate race DNF rates by driver, team, and track
- Understand feature relationships with outcomes (correlations, visual trends)

#### **5.3 Feature Engineering**
- Extract and construct features such as:
  - Driver and constructor win rates
  - Number of prior races for each driver
  - Track characteristics
  - Weather conditions

#### **5.4 Modeling**
- **Classification Model 1:** Will the driver finish the race?
  - Target: Binary classification (Finished vs Did Not Finish)
- **Classification Model 2:** Will the driver finish on the podium?
  - Target: Multi-class classification or Top 3 vs Others

#### **5.5 Model Evaluation**
- Use train/test split or cross-validation
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualize results using confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.

#### **5.6 App Interface**
- Create a Streamlit app
  - Inputs: Driver, constructor, track, qualifying position
  - Output: Predicted finish status, probability, and insights
